# ARDIF
Amateur Radio Digital Image Format - Experimental ham radio image format

## ARCHIVED
I'm not working on ARDIF anymore. Other modes such as SSTV, DRM, and MFSK Image seem to work better.
In the future I will make a digital fax mode for printed documents.

## Spec
See [spec.md](spec.md)

## Setup
For the library,

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

For the Web site,

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    pip3 install -r server-requirements.txt

## Library
(docs coming soon)

## Server
`server.py` is a Flask app providing a simple Web site for creating and
reading ARDIF messages.
